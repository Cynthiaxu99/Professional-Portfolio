This timeline provides a concise overview of 
the key milestones in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). 

From the theoretical foundations laid by Alan Turing in the 1950s 
to the rise of deep learning and powerful large language models in the 21st century, 
AI has evolved rapidly through waves of innovation, setbacks, and breakthroughs.

The timeline highlights historical moments 
such as the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, 
where the term “artificial intelligence” was first coined, 
the invention of early neural networks like the Perceptron, 
the AI winters caused by funding cuts, 
and later resurgences fueled by increased computational power, big data, 
and new algorithms like deep neural networks. 

It also includes landmark achievements like IBM’s Deep Blue defeating a world chess champion, 
AlphaGo mastering the game of Go, 
and the emergence of transformer models like 
GPT and BERT that now power many real-world applications.

This snapshot serves as a foundation for understanding where AI came from—and where it may be headed.
