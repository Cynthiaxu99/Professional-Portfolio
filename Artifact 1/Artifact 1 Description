In AIML-500, we worked as a team developed an AI-powered chatbot designed to help users discover nearby food options and choose dishes based on personalized criteria such as location, budget, cuisine preferences, dietary restrictions, and dining context (e.g., lunch with coworkers, solo dinner, or a casual meal with friends). Built using ChatGPT and integrated with location and user input features, this demo version showcases how conversational AI can enhance decision-making in everyday scenarios like dining out.

The chatbot simulates natural dialogue to guide users through their preferences and recommend meals or restaurants tailored to their needs. While this version is still in development, it demonstrates the core functionality and potential of AI to personalize and streamline the dining experience. Future improvements will include real-time restaurant data, deeper integration with user profiles, and more advanced natural language understanding. This project highlights both the capabilities and practical applications of AI in user-centric service design.
