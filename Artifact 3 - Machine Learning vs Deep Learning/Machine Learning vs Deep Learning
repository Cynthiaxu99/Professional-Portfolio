##### Real World Example 1

Telecom companies collect gigantic amounts of structured data 
from customer contacts, billing history, usage patterns, and support calls. 
To reduce churn rate, these companies utilize 
Support Vector Machines (SVM) and other machine learning models to 
find trends in previous data that indicate a client is about to quit.

Verizon, for example, leverages predictive analytics to 
identify accounts with a history of service concerns or plan downgrades. 
Once identified, these consumers can be actively targeted with 
specific retention offers, discounts, or upgraded service plans. T
hey also use churn models to alert their customer service representatives, 
allowing them to act before the consumer decides to cancel. 
This not only increases retention, but also lowers the cost of gaining new consumers.

#### Machine learning vs Deep learning in example 1

Machine learning models like SVMs are well-suited for structured data 
where the goal is binary classification (e.g., will a customer leave or stay). 
Telecom data like contract length, usage, and billing history are structured features. 
SVM can determine the optimal boundary between churn and non-churn customers 
It's efficient and effective with moderate-sized datasets 
and doesn't require unnecessary computing resources.

This use case is not suitable for deep learning models. 
Deep learning algorithms, such as neural networks, 
tend to overfit limited or structured datasets 
and require a huge quantity of data to perform effectively. 
They are also more difficult to train and comprehend, 
providing no advantage over traditional models in this type of challenge.



##### Real World Example 2

Apple Face ID analyzes a user's face geometry 
using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
which map hundreds of infrared dots onto the surface to create a depth map. 
This deep learning model evolves over time, 
detecting minor variations such as facial hair, glasses, or aging. 
It is used not simply to unlock phones, 
but also to make secure payments and authenticate apps.

#### Machine learning vs Deep learning in example 2
CNNs are specifically built to operate on picture data. 
They use filters and many layers to recognize spatial hierarchies in pixel data 
(such as edges, textures, and forms). 
This eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and 
enables the model to learn directly from raw photos, 
making it suitable for facial recognition and object detection.

Machine learning models are not suitable in this case 
because it requires a manual extraction of image attributes 
(e.g., color histograms, shapes), 
which is time-consuming and ineffective. 
These models also struggle to represent spatial relationships in pixels.
