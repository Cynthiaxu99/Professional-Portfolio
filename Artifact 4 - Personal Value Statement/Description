Objective:
To critically reflect on my leadership values as a business analyst 
and develop a practical framework for identifying and addressing 
human bias in data-driven decision-making. 
This artifact was created to demonstrate my commitment to 
ethical, inclusive, and thoughtful analysis practices 
in both technical and interpersonal contexts.

Process:
I began by examining real-world examples and academic literature on 
how bias enters business analysis workflows. 
I reflected on personal experiences in project leadership 
and synthesized key insights from ethics in 
data analytics, human-centered design, and organizational behavior. 

Tools:
I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) to help brainstorm terminology, 
refine language, and cross-reference ethical principles with current industry practices.

Value Proposition:
This artifact highlights my ability to lead data projects ethically, 
foster inclusive collaboration, 
and apply critical thinking to address systemic bias. 
It shows I’m not only technically capable 
but also deeply aware of the human implications behind 
data models and business decisions—essential qualities for today’s analytics leaders.
