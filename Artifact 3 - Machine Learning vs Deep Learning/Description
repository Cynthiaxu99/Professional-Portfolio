Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning Use Cases

The Object of this artifact is to 
compare the suitability of machine learning and deep learning 
for real-world applications

I analyzed structured and unstructured data use cases, 
researched industry examples such as Verizon and Apple, 
and explained why specific models are more appropriate for different types of problems.

Microsoft Word and ChatGPT were used to research and structure the comparison.

This artifact demonstrates my ability to 
evaluate AI model effectiveness 
based on data types and business needs. 
It highlights my understanding of when to apply machine learning (e.g., SVMs for churn prediction) 
versus deep learning (e.g., CNNs for facial recognition), 
showcasing practical knowledge critical to real-world data analysis.
